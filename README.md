## Java Piscine (Bootcamp) for School 21 (Ecole 42), July 2022

A 14-day long intensive course covering topics from Java Core (Including, Reflection API, Collections, JDBC and Multi-Threading) to Spring & Sockets.

Each repository contains day's subject and checklist.
 The Java piscine is developed in order to overcome the barrier to entry to the professional field. All days of the piscine are focused on learning and understanding the Java infrastructure and basic technologies which are used in enterprise development. Acquired knowledge will help you to understand the main language mechanics and develop the software conforming to the generally accepted standards.
